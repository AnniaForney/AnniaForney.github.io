Blog Post Entry for CLI Project


For my CLI project I have chosen to scrape from a crystal website. I chose this website because I have an interest in crystals, collect them, and wanted to choose a website that consists of one of my interest. It’s advised that you based this project and future projects off of your interest because you’ll be fully engaged in what you’re coding. 

The challenge for me in this project was getting started. I built my project via Learn through sandbox and the first challenge was re-opening my project. Overtime I’d close out of the application my work was being saved to my gituhub repository but I was able to access what I had built. Instead of the regular git clone GitHub url and git remote -v method I had to use the following method: git remote rm origin, git clone url, cd into to the title of the project, then git remote -v. All of these commands were needed for me to pick up where I left of in the project. 

Another lessoned learned in the project is saving your work. The three most crucial commands for saving your work: git add . , git commit -m ‘’, git push. Every time you git commit you must enter a message in the quotations that has to do with the changes you just made. 

In terms of the actual project scraping can be difficult when it comes to the specifics of what you want grab from the website. I tried to scrape the different names of crystals along with their meanings. The one thing that was helpful is the website put the crystals in alphabetical order. The crystal names are also stored in an array so I can write the crystal name method along with the css. The css. in ruby rails is what allows the coder to pull from the website when inserting the url and nokogiri prior to creating a method to collect all the crystals.
